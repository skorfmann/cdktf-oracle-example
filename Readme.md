# Terraform CDK with the Oracle (OCI) provider

Right now there's an issue which prevents this from compiling - See here: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/issues/290

Once that's fixed, this will work as any other provider in the [cdktf examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/tree/master/examples)
